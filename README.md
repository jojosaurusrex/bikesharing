## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to introduce the class to Tableau. Learning how to use the interface we learned:
- how to import data
- use worksheets, dashboards, and stories
- differences between rows and columns
- work with filters
- how to change measurement type and datatype

## Summary
With all of the data and the visualizations above, it is quite simple to come to the conclusion that our largest subset of consumers happen to be male subscribers, who happen to largly use the service for commuting to and from work. With the given data, I would also create a visualization for checkout time for non-subscribers, as well as, a visualization for trip duration based on age for all of our users and add on filters for gender and user type.
